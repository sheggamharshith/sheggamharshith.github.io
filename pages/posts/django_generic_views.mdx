## Introduction

In the realm of web development, efficiency and compatibility often stand as pillars of robust application design. Django Rest Framework's (DRF) Generic Views emerge as a quintessential toolkit, offering developers a streamlined and versatile approach to handling common RESTful patterns.

What makes DRF's Generic Views an indispensable asset is their innate compatibility with an array of third-party libraries. These views seamlessly integrate with various 3rd party libraries, embracing functionalities like pagination, filtering, and serialization without compromising simplicity or flexibility.

## Essential Traits of GenericViewSet: A Comprehensive Exploration

- GenericViewSet require couple of concepts such as router, queryset, permission's in DRF to understand it correctly.

  - [**Router**](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/routers/#routers) you need to either use simple router or default router to construct the GET,POST,PUT,DELETE automatically by adding the respective mixins.

    | URL Pattern       | Associated Mixin  | HTTP Method(s) |
    | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
    | `^samples/$`      | ListModelMixin    | GET            |
    | `^samples/$`      | CreateModelMixin  | POST           |
    | `^samples/{pk}/$` | UpdateModelMixin  | PUT            |
    | `^samples/{pk}/$` | DestroyModelMixin | DELETE         |

  - **QuerySet** You need to pass the required model query set here
    ```python
    queryset = Sample.objects.all()
    ```
  - **Permission** You need pass the permission class to permission_classes attribute.

- Basic outline how an ideal GenericViewSet class will be.
  ```python
  class TaskViewSet(ListModelMixin, GenericViewSet):
      queryset = Task.objects.all()
      serializer_class = TaskSerializer
      permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
  ```

## Mixins and Customization.

Customizing mixins without altering their core functionalities, such as pagination or serialization, poses a significant challenge. However,
I've outlined several methods below that allow for customization while maintaining the core patterns. These methods are categorized based on the type of mixins used.

### ListModelMixin

#### Explanation of ListView

- The first thing comes to your mind is how do i modify the queryset on the go, below is the example

- Custom user or current user.

```python
    class TaskViewSet(ListModelMixin, GenericViewSet):
      queryset = Task.objects.all()
      serializer_class = TaskSerializer
      permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    # when you want to have user
    def get_queryset(self):
      Task.objects.filter(user=self.request.user)
```

- Query Params.

```python
    def get_queryset(self):
      Task.objects.filter(param=self.request.query_params.get("q"))
```

- Path Params

```python
   def get_queryset(self):
       username = self.kwargs['username']
       return Task.objects.filter(task__username=username)
```

> ⚠️ Don't perform any-other customization apart of native object filter method in get_queryset. for further customization see the below example.

### Further Customization with ListModelMixin.

- Before diving dep let's understand the ListModel mixin's native code. [Docs link](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/#listmodelmixin)

```python
class ListModelMixin:
    """
    List a queryset.
    """
    def list(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        queryset = self.filter_queryset(self.get_queryset())

        # checks if can apply the paginate_queryset
        page = self.paginate_queryset(queryset)
        if page is not None:
            # applies the serialization.
            serializer = self.get_serializer(page, many=True)
            return self.get_paginated_response(serializer.data)

        # no pagination configured in your settings.
        serializer = self.get_serializer(queryset, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)

```

If you observe the above code it does the job for most of the common patterns.
Unfortunately there are no other method such as `perform_create` that we have for the CreateModelMixin. For the listModelMixin we don't have any.
There is strong reason to do so you can use the serializer class [method](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields/#serializermethodfield).

> You can still implement the same logic to maintain consistency with listModelMixin.

```python
class PerformListModelMixin(ListModelMixin):
    """helps to modify data before doing paggination or queryset stiff"""

    def list(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        queryset = self.filter_queryset(self.get_queryset())  # type: ignore

        # perform list
        queryset = self.perform_list(queryset)

        page = self.paginate_queryset(queryset)  # type: ignore
        if page is not None:
            serializer = self.get_serializer(page, many=True)  # type: ignore
            return self.get_paginated_response(serializer.data)  # type: ignore

        serializer = self.get_serializer(queryset, many=True)  # type: ignore
        return Response(serializer.data)

    def perform_list(self, queryset, *args, **kwargs):
        """helps to modify the list"""
        return queryset

```
### Customizing permission classes
You can also customize the permission based on method's. let say you want to add different permission's based on different params/methods you can still do that.

```python 

    def get_permissions(self, request, view) ->list[PermissionClass]:
        if request.method == 'GET':
            return [GetPermissionClass] 
        elif request.method == 'POST':
            return [PostPermissionClass]
        elif request.method == 'PUT' or request.method == 'DELETE':
            return [PutOrDeletePermissionClass]
        return False  #
```

### Customize serializer class
You can also customize the serializer based on method. 

```python 

    def get_serializer(self, request, view) -> SerializerClass:
        if request.method == 'GET':
            return GetSerializerClass
        if request.method == 'List':
            return ListSerializerClass 
        elif request.method == 'POST':
            return PostSerializerClass
        return False  #
```

## Conclusion

The GenericViewSet can be a game-changer once you grasp its method and call flow. Understanding these aspects allows you to tweak only the necessary parameters, unlocking its full potential while maintaining control over your customization.
