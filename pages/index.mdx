# Your Name

Hey there, my self 👨‍💻 Harshith Sheggam
a full stack developer who codes with the precision of a master chef 👨‍🍳 and cooks with the creativity of a seasoned coder.
While I craft impeccable code sandwiches by day, I'm simmering up delightful dishes in my coding kitchen by night.
Think of me as the HTML-haute-cuisine aficionado and Python pastry chef rolled into one! Just like in cooking, debugging
code requires the perfect blend of flavors – a dash of patience, a pinch of creativity, and a sprinkle of problem-solving skills.
When I'm not debugging, you'll find me decoding recipes as meticulously as I decode bugs in my code.
So, let's embark on this delightfuljourney of mixing and merging tech and taste! Bon appétit 🍽️ and happy coding! ✨
